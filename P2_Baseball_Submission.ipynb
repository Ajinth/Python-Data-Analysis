    "* Analyzing the \"Strikeouts\" and the \"HomeRuns\" aspects of the batters and if there is any relationship among the two batting statistics. The other questions that this analysis helps answer is whether a high strikeout for a batter is a bad thing or does it mean that the high strikeout could also mean that higher a chance of a batter clearing the field for a home run? The analysis also goes and extra step and apply a linear regression model between the dependent and the independent variable and confirms or provides positive support to the results of the co-relation analysis\n",

    "* On further analysis around some of the other offensive statistics to look for in batters it came across the OPS is a good metric. OPS looks at not only the ability of the batter to get to base, but also the ability of the batter to HIT. On some more thought, if OPS covers the two important aspects of batting, it made sense to ask the question as to how this co-related with the runs scored by the batter during the season. Hence this analysis was focussed on looking at the \"OPS\" and the \"Runs Scored\" and the related co-relation.\n",

This process is called imputation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics). However for the purposes of this project we are not going to be doing that. That said, I have tried to give \"test train split\" approach and calculated the predicted values. I have also calculated the R Square value, which is another measure to explain the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. However these additional statistical tests where done to just cross check the results of my correlation test. "

That said, batters who have a high strikeout rate it might not always be a bad thing. It might just mean that they are very aggressive batters and are willing to take the risk of giving the ball a good hit and send it a long distance and in the process there are occasions when they strikeout, contributing to their high strike rate. On the flipside they could also be racking up some high Homeruns during the season.

    "For someone like me who is trying to learn baseball from the heels of a very similar game in cricket,  the batting average is a huge statistic in cricket and in most cases a high batting average in a season more or less means high number of runs scored. The analysis looks at whether batting average is a good measure of the runs scored by a batsman. Ideally speaking (and also based on my experience with following stats in Cricket), a high batting average generally means the batsman is an above average batsman, which should almost always translate to the runs scored. \n",

Hence we can safely assume that teams whose batters would have a high OPS would result in the respective teams having higher runs scored. We could also apply the linear regression as performed in the first analysis to further confirm this theory and calculating the R Squared value. This conclusion by no means states that OPS is the one and only offensive statistics. Recently another good batting statistics that has been thrown around and used a lot is the Weighted On Base Average (WOBA). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOBA"
